This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the `COSC315DD` database. The goal was to inventory 
the schema, analyze entity relationships, identify design anomalies, and extract business insights using SQL.

`DB-Detective-Submission.md`: The final report containing task results, anomalies, and business facts.

`DBIM.sql`: The full schema export including `CREATE TABLE` statements and constraints.
